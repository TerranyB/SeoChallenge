# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this challenge, I made several minor changes to a pre-existing starter code including an html file and a css file. Minor changes made were adding commentary and notes to the code to see where stlyes began and ended as well as changing some coding in the html file to <section> instead of <div> for easier readibility.
